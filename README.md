<em>Simple <a href="https://www.opengl.org"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Opengl-logo.svg" align="center" width=50/></h1></a> project to test the efficiency of QuadTrees and batch rendering.

# What I did ðŸ’­

- Batch Rendering with customizable batch size
- Up to 8 (I chose 8 just because, but it could depend on the machine) texture units
- Quad Tree implementation to reduce overhead
- Quad Tree can return a list of quads to be rendered
- Quad Tree can use lambdas to call a function directly on every found quad
- Mouse can seamlessly move the scene and change color of intersecting quads

# Sadly ðŸ˜”
**There is not much to say, I'll keep exploring rendering techniques on future projects**

# Improvements ðŸ¤¯
- [ ] QuadTree could store its memory in root branch and not spread deep in the tree ðŸŒ²
- [ ] The renderer could feature a VBO per texture so that the batch is not flushed until there is no more room for quads with that given texture or a new texture is uploaded
- [ ] Instancing/Batching hybrid approach (This simple only-quad project would have worked better instancing, but the point was to test QuadTrees and batching)
- [ ] Multi-threading ðŸ¤“
- [ ] Clean up the code (there is always room for that) ðŸ§¹
